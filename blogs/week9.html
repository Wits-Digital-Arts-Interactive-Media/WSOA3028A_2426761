        Readings: ‘Towards a study of information geographies’ and ‘How Geography shapes -and is shaped by- the internet’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok. Let me start off by saying these readings were somewhat long and made some fairly interesting points about the access to information
        and the internet across the globe. The first textual discussed how there’s an uneven spread of power and information access across the world.
        Let’s take a look at South Africa for example regarding this topic. South Africa is one of many countries that does not cater to the majority
        in terms of having access to internet. The internet access across South Africa is limited to a select few that can afford internet/wifi.
        Giving more people access to internet in South Africa could be majorly beneficial for businesses, education, economics, and general
        improvement of South Africa as a whole. Let’s not even get into the whole dispute about access to power. The loadshedding crisis in South
        Africa affects so much regarding access to the internet and information. If this is remedied, there can be further developments in ensuring
        access to information and power is achieved across the entire country. As mentioned in the reading, for information to flow in and out of
        certain areas, infrastructure, socio-economic conditions and cultural context needs to be taken into consideration. These aspects are what
        makes areas so unique and introducing access to information to these places, needs to be done to ensure there is some conservation and
        preservation of these things.
      </p>

				This reading goes into detail about how there is a digital divide between those with access to information, and those without. The article 
        discusses how this contributes to inequality with access to information resources across religions and socio-economic groups. The cultural 
        differences in South Africa are very vast and the lack of information across the country affects the ability to teach, share and include
        people in these various cultures, traditions and societies. Information reduces ignorance, and I think, despite South Africa knowing as much
        as they do about different cultures, learning more about certain traditions and practices would do South Africa, and the rest of the world,
        a lot of good. Power and control is also something mentioned in the paper that is quite vital in that, the difference in accesses to
        information contributes to power dynamics in information flow. Understanding these things is essential for ensuring there is no misuse of 
        digital rights, privacy and freedom of expression. This is vital for the world we currently live in and will only become that more important
        with the several advances in technology being made. Ensuring people understand their rights to these things mentioned, is important for the 
        user’s protection and for overall knowledge of how the digital world works and how to interact with it. Having access to information helps 
        with networking and can get people, businesses and companies far. The lack of information can cause stagnation in development and growth in
        many factors, and as a South African, I’m sure of many ways the access of information can help our country.

				The second reading speaks about the relationship between geography and the internet and how they influence each other. The paper discusses
        how physical infrastructure of the internet is influenced by geography. Things like cables, data centres and network nodes are taken into 
        consideration based on how they can be maintained and developed regarding geographical factors like topography and climate. Taking this into
        consideration for South Africa, I think that we have a fairly good topology for these infrastructures. With regards to climate, I think 
        South Africa has a particularly interesting climate. All the physical infrastructure may have issues regarding the heat during South
        Africa’s summers and springs, however this can be remedied by implementing colling systems. Similar to the first paper, the second paper 
        talks about how there can be urban and rural development with access to high-speed internet, and how it can create many opportunities and
        increase the quality of life amongst communities in both urban and rural areas. This would do great in South Africa as there is a vast
        combination of rural and urban communities throughout the country. Introducing the access to information and internet across both these 
        groups, will improve their opportunities and help improve opportunities and their way of life. It will also create a bridge between the two
        area, which will give insight to either side and a platform to start providing help where necessary.

				Again, the discussion on interactions and social exchange is mentioned here in the second reading. I think, just like I mentioned above, 
        that access to the internet will provide a great way to learn about different countries, cultures and traditions. The second reading 
        mentions how the relationship between geography and the internet can also assist politically. I agree in that there can be many political 
        advances and changes, if the access to the internet becomes more global and widely used. It can help support digital innovation and 
        entrepreneurship, along with safeguarding digital rights and freedoms. It can be the start of collaborative efforts between governments, 
        industry and civil societies. It creates a more democracy way of life amongst people and will allow insight to how things can be addressed
        and helped. For South Africa it would be a tremendous help, as people in rural areas can get the assistance they need and have continual 
        aid to ensure improvements are made. It will also allow for South Africa to have many allies around the world with input from citizens and
        how they would like their country to be benefited.
			</p>
			<p>
				Altogether, ensuring access to the internet in all parts of the world, will do more justice to the improvement of lives and the 
        opportunities it creates for them. Looking on a smaller scale, it will also do so much for South Africa in developing the technological 
        side of things and the general way pf life.

				<b>Javascript adventures:</b>
				This week we worked on including javascript into our html code. It was actually super cool to see how it worked in conjunction with the html
        code. It looked pretty cool and made me feel like I was making some progress with my website. I will continue to add more javascript to me 
        code and ensure that everything starts coming together before the next assignment. I’ll tell you more about it next week.
