		<h2>Ethical Internet</h2>
		<h3>Week 13 (13/05 - 17/05)</h3>

				<h4>Readings:</h4>
				The internet as a moral space: the legacy of Roger Silverstone
			</p>
			<p>
				The reading is actually pretty cool. It talks about how Mr. Silverstone here considered the internet as a moral space. The media is said 
				to be one of the main means for being social, learning about politics, economics and cultural processes. Media is one of the grounds for 
				social life and this suggests that the internet is deeply embedded into the broader media environment, it influences can be influenced by 
				other societal processes. It is important that because of these things the media space is made to be as moral and as ethical as possible. 
				Having such a large impact on people, media should be a place in which people can learn values and grow morally from what they see on the
				internet. Of course, this isn’t so easy and doesn’t comply with today’s society and what we are exposed to and have access to on the 
				internet. Silverstone is trying to advocate for a media that promotes responsibility, care, and understanding towards others. He points
				out that there is a lack of moral consideration among online communication. I think this is so true. Today’s society is so full of 
				judgement and lacks care towards others. It is important that those values are brought back, and I think what Silverstone is trying to do
				is very important for the future of society.
			</p>
			<p>
				The article talks about many moral implications of various concepts central to internet studies. Silverstone warned against confusing 
				online connection and intimacy with responsibility. He talks about a shift from self-focus to prioritising others and moral responsibility.
				I think this is such a great point. Looking at society today, a lot of people care more about themselves than others. It’s not only 
				blatantly seen across social media, but it’s also become a norm now offline too. Yes, it is always great to think about yourself and
				put yourself first in order to get to where you want to be in life, however thinking of others is just as important and builds you in 
				many ways too.
			</p>
			<p>
				The text taps into the idea of the internet contributing to or harming this environment’s moral health. He asks that people take care and
				be responsible in ensuring that media shown across the internet displays moral values and teachings. He also suggests that further studies
				are done to learn how the internet harms the moral views and values that influence people that use media so often. I think that this
				would benefit social media and monitor what is being said on the internet that does not consider the possibilities of being malic towards
				people who engage with such forms of the media.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4>Reflection on the internet being an ethical space:</h4>
				Essentially, I would think that the internet as an ethical space would mean a space that has no form of malice, rudeness, discrimination,
				bias or any other forms of unfairness. Of course, this is difficult to execute, and we’d have to think about things such as joking 
				behaviours to which people don’t take offence. As much as I would love for the internet to be a fully safe and an ethical space, there 
				is too much at stake that can be affected by this. It can potentially make the internet a boring space to be in. Of course, if it does
				get to that stage ever, it is important that core values and moral views are executed and projected through the media in order to ensure
				there are no further forms of harm or danger. Although, reaching a compete moral and safe space may be difficult, we can combat things
				that are outright nasty in the media and across the internet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Things like discrimination against certain societies and groups, ensuring there are limitations on what children can have access to on 
				the internet, misinformation, and much more.
			</p>

				<h4>Coding update:</h4>				
				Well, this week we’ve been looking into how to use css for our websites and it’s been so exciting. I actually watched the tutorial and 
				lecture videos and it’s been so helpful and informative. I also got around to talking to Imaan about stuff regarding my website and she
				basically reassured my crazy creative designs. I still need to look into flexbox and understand how it works, but incorporating css has 
				been pretty fun so far. I still need to wrap my head around the different metrics for scaling things and setting things for my website, 
				but I think that will come with more practice and playing around with everything, along with checking responsiveness.
