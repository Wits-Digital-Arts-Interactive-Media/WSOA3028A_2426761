    <h2>Digital Colonialism: How it impacts developing countries and South Africans today</h2>
    <section>
      <p>        
        South Africa has endured colonialism before, and now we must face colonialism digitally too? Colonialism is being reinvented in the Global
        South through the dominance of digital technology, whereby it is being used for political, economic, and social control [1]. Sareeta 
        Amrute talks about the ways to identify digital colonialism in action and mentions that ‘a colonial relationship is hierarchical, 
        extractive and exploitative’ [2]. This will be used as the basis to discuss the issues regarding digital colonialism and how it impacts
        the world and South Africans in current time.
      </p>
      <p>
      Amrute goes into detail explaining the different points she makes about a colonial relationship. Superiority amongst the colonizing and 
        inferiority amongst the colonized is what creates the hierarchies that give way to extraction and exploitation. Where extraction is the 
        removal of something (resources, wealth, labour, etc.) from the colonized, to benefit the colonizers [3], and exploitation is labour
        relations that take advantage of the state monopoly over direct or indirect violence through applied pressures [2]. She links this to the 
        tech industry and how it is used to colonize the Global South, Amrute discusses her take on colonial relationships through digital 
        technology and explains that data, new applications, and social media are developed to produce an ideology of superiority. They are used 
        to promote certain communities over others to create some sort of hierarchy, not to mention that the industries behind these notions are 
        at the absolute top of the hierarchy list. Extraction in terms of tech is talked about in two categories, the first being extraction of 
        minerals and mined resources to make the hardware used for the technological devices and how rare earth metals are mined and built into 
        said devices, the second is data extraction, where information about anyone and anything is captured through applications whose terms 
        demand that people give up their personal and private information [2]. The second form of extraction mentioned is treated as raw data and
        is used by tech companies for their own growth and gain, which is an important aspect of obtaining power over the world. Everyday forms 
        of exploitation are described as labour relationships in outsourcing programming, in economy work, and in the many forms of labour that
        are hidden in technologies to appear to function without human aid [2]. People are being employed to do microwork, be workers as well as
        customers, and are monitored for ‘worker safety’ in order to track their every movement to ‘increase productivity’. This means that 
        workers are demanded to work harder, take fewer breaks, work longer hours, and eliminate wasted movements. Due to workers not having 
        control of how this data is collected while they work, there is very little that can be done to prevent such systems from being punitive 
        rather than protective of the worker. Amrute’s overall point being that colonialism in tech has uneven consequences and malevolent 
        paternalism [2].
      </p>
      <p>
        Amrute composes several compelling points about digital colonialism and makes it easy to identify when this blatantly occurs through 
        anything relating to technology and the digital space. In an article by the CNBC, it is said that Google laid off at least 200 employees
        from their core teams, in a reorganization that will include moving roles to India and Mexico [4]. The article goes on to mention that
        Alphabet eliminated around 12,000 jobs and has continued laying off workforce since, to outsource in India and Mexico as well. Alphabet 
        reported a 15% jump in their first quarter revenue from the previous year and announced their first ever dividend and a buyback of 70 
        billion dollars [4]. In some way this may appear to be a good thing for India and Mexico, as they are provided with more work positions 
        and are given the opportunity to work for these major companies and contribute to their development however, Google and Alphabet are 
        exploiting India and Mexico through hard labour for their own profitable gain.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a blog Mark Daniel Abaricio explains that there are many benefits for major companies outsourcing to developing countries such as [5]:
				<ul> -	Lower labour costs which entails having workers from developing countries doing more work for less pay in order to increase company	profitability.</ul>
        <ul> -	Access to a larger pool of skilled workers mainly in the IT and engineering fields, which gives companies access to a more diverse and larger talent pool.</ul> 
        <ul> -	Increased efficiency, as companies can take advantage of the many different time zones and have work being done around the clock.</ul>
				<ul> -	Access to new markets, which allows for companies to access new markets and customers, as well as providing them with an understanding of the local market dynamics.</ul>
				<ul> -	Government incentives, whereby tax breaks are offered to companies that outsource to their developing country, which further reduces cost for increased profitability.</ul>
				<ul> -	Cultural diversity and global perspective, where outsourcing exposes companies to new and diverse cultures, traditions, perspectives and unique ways of thinking, which can lead to new ideas and innovation.</ul>
        Abaricio’s blog goes on to mention the top in-demand developing countries for outsourcing, with India, China and Mexico being listed in the top five [5].
      </p>
      <p>
        Google and Alphabet are taking advantage of and manipulating the labour in these countries, as well as thriving from the added benefits 
        stated above. They explain that the layoffs are to ‘expand in high-growth workforce locations to work closer to partners and developer 
        communities’ [4] in order to maintain their hierarchy while they extract from and exploit India and Mexico. Along with these companies 
        saving on labour costs by outsourcing, they are also avoiding paying for employee benefits, transportation costs, meals, etc. which will
        also ultimately increase their profitability and further lower the overall expenditure of the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are so many companies that lay off workers and employees without care, to outsource for cheaper and more efficient work. In a TIME 
        article about lay offs by ‘Big Tech’, it is explained how major well-known companies dismiss employees quickly and carelessly to replace 
        them with inexpensive, hard labour for larger income. In 2022, Meta laid off 11,000 workers, after Elon Musk took over Twitter, 3,000 
        employees were dismissed, Amazon prepared to cut 10,000 jobs, and Microsoft announced smaller cuts [6]. The article goes on to say that
        employees who were earning large salaries in these companies were not the only workers affected. Employees earning a few dollars a day had
        also lost their jobs, which could have pushed them below the poverty line. The level of digital colonialism at this point has forced the
        people affected into inconvenient situations, making their job positions unsecure, their living circumstances temperamental, and their 
        possibility for finding new work problematic. CloudFactory, an outsourcing company with offices in Kenya and Nepal, also faced major 
        employee cuts and counted Microsoft as one of their 600 clients. CloudFactory said that their departing employees would be offered severance
        pay and did not specify how much. Due to the labour laws in Nepal having fewer protections over workers, the affected CloudFactory staff 
        were dismissed almost immediately [6]. This goes to show how large corporate tech companies are not only laying off workers and employees 
        in their own workplace and home country but are laying off workers they’ve outsourced to find even cheaper labour and more efficient work 
        in other countries, while doing so with malevolent paternalism and getting away with it. Dismissing workers almost immediately leaves people
        standard and forces them into a period of unemployment they did not plan for. It shows complete disrespect and a huge lack of care for the 
        people working tirelessly, for less pay, who helped the company get to where it is. In this TIME article, one of the Kenyan employees were
        interviewed and explained that it is difficult to find work in Kenya and before being dismissed they earned less than fifty dollars a day. 
        They go on to say that people with loans from banks do not have the means to service them after being dismissed [6]. With digital 
        colonialism being so prevalent, it is difficult to combat these malicious actions by big industries because the work is often masked as
        new and better opportunities for the people in developing countries that are being outsourced, as a way to extract from and exploit them 
        until they are no longer needed and eventually tossed aside with the help of labour laws that do not protect employees. This is a global
        issue mainly affecting the Global South and makes you wonder how it affects our country (South Africa) today.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of big companies outsource to South Africa and in an article from BuninessTech, it is explained why. The article discusses how South 
        Africa is one of the first scouting choices for companies in the United Kingdom (UK) and is the second most attractive Business Process 
        Outsourcing (BPO) location in the world [7]. It is explained that South Africa is home to a highly educated and skilled workforce, with 
        many individuals holding IT, software development, business and marketing degrees [7]. South Africa is said to be outsourced for their high
        standard of education and experience, work ethic, diversity, culture and time zone. It is also stated that South Africans work 43.3 hours a 
        week, placing them 5th highest in the world and it is known that many employees work more hours than the maximum limit according to labour
        laws. These dedicated workers and their strong work ethic conditions South Africans to be adaptable and fast paced, which ultimately aids 
        big corporate tech companies in exploiting and extracting to the maximum possibility, to help advance their businesses and companies without
        helping the employed South Africans to the same extent. With South Africa having a large mix of ethnic and cultural diversity, it gives way
        to creating a dynamic workforce that is well populated for companies to learn about and learn from, thus making the extraction and 
        exploitation processes all the more easy.
      </p>

        South Africa also faces digital colonialism by being subjected to control and large influence from big tech companies, often from foreign 
        countries. An example of a South African software development company that faces these challenges is Nomanini [8], which is a local 
        enterprise payment solution company that navigates dominance of global payment and financial technology providers. They are a succeeding 
        company, but their ability to innovate and compete is influenced by the policies of larger international fintech companies. Praekelt.org [9]
        is another example of a South African social impact-focused tech company that is a victim to digital colonialism. Praekelt.org uses mobile 
        technology to improve the lives of people in low-income communities. They collaborate with international partnerships which suggests that 
        their dependency on foreign technology and funding is a form of digital colonialism. These companies, among many other South African tech 
        companies, are unconsciously subjected to digital colonialism by relying on international countries to help aid their companies in 
        development. This could mean that foreign companies are using these partnerships as additional flow of income, as a means to learn how 
        customers and workers perform in order to adapt their own businesses to cater to the South African market, as well as selectively 
        incorporating ideas of innovation they may learn from these South African companies.
        </p>
      <p>
        Digital colonialism also has significant gender impacts globally and often leads to exploitation of female labour in outsourced tech jobs. 
        Women in South Africa and other developing countries are often employed in low-wage jobs or work in fields for less than the work they 
        produce. With that being said, there is a significant gender pay gap in many fields of work, especially in the tech industry. In an article
        by Sinazo Mkoko, it states that women occupy 23% of tech jobs in South Africa [10]. This displays the issue of gender inequality in the tech
        industry, which is a factor of digital colonialism as women are exploited for their efforts to better companies at a very low cost. They
        also endure the lack of protection in terms of labour laws, while contributing the same, if not more, than men in tech industries. Women in
        South Africa are generally not exposed to technology and therefore fall short of an education they can acquire and the ability to influence
        and start movements that can help benefit their well being and contribution to the tech and digital space. Mkoko discusses how the gender 
        pay gap in South Africa’s tech space is increasing each year. As of 2022, the gender pay gap amongst entry level developers was 6.4% and 
        has more than doubled to 13.2% in 2023 [10]. This figure widens to as much as 16.3% in 2022 for senior developers and increased to 25.7% in
        2023 [10]. This goes to show, without mentioning the difference in the gender pay gap amongst women of different race groups, that women in 
        developing countries are the biggest victims to digital colonialism. They are exploited based on the country they live in, their gender and 
        their race all to for big corporate companies to allow their businesses and profits thrive.

        Amrute talks about how colonialism is a relationship and not a time period [2], and therefore with a collective effort this relationship can
        be shifted or changed. As a South African woman, who will be working in the South African tech industry, my role to help shift that 
        relationship is to address the systematic inequalities that affect South African tech employees and help spread awareness about it. This 
        can be done by advocating and supporting policies that promote hiring and advancement of women, especially women of colour, in the tech 
        industry, mentor and teach young people who are interested in tech by sharing experiences and guidance to aid in encouraging their entry 
        and development within the digital space, and promoting young South Africans to pursue careers in STEM. Trying to encourage an inclusive 
        workspace where diverse perspectives are considered and respected can also be effective, as well as supporting and collaborating with local
        businesses. Another way to help against digital colonialism is to build and network with online communities in South Africa to share 
        knowledge and create a strong support structure for South Africans to provide common resources, and to make use of ethical technology that 
        does not enforce biases and report them if they do. Trying to tackle digital colonialism and attempting to prevent it can be difficult with
        the amount of influence major tech companies have over developing countries, but it is important to try and it is important to start for the
        benefit of countries that have faced colonialism in many forms, so that we can preserve, develop and benefit from what big tech companies 
        are after.
