		<h3>Ethical UI and UX design: NetFlorist</h3>
		<p>
			Ethical user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design goes far beyond how an interface looks and how functional it is for their users. 
			The effects these designs have on the user’s mental health, privacy, inclusivity, along with many other aspects needs to be taken into 
			consideration. A few various ethical designs regarding UI and UX will be broken down, explained, and used to analyse the ethical interactions 
			of the designated South African website, NetFlorist [1].
		</p>
		<p>
			In an article called ‘Do you even know the ethics UI/UX design?’, on the platform ‘Medium’ [2], there are a list of things designers need to 
			assess to achieve optimal ethical user experience and engagement. The writer discusses a few key aspects that contribute to these ethics,
			which will be condensed into a few points and discussed, starting with ‘The Allure to addictive design’. This talks about how certain features
			on a platform can cause addictive experiences. Features such as infinite scrolling, auto playing videos, and push notifications keeps users 
			engaged and interacting with the platform for longer than necessary. This is an unethical way to boost engagement with the platform and
			contributes to unhealthy mannerisms that can negatively impact the user’s mental health and make them unproductive.
		</p>
		<p>
			Keeping data private or encrypting data is a good ethical UI/UX design feature platforms should have. Platforms or interfaces that require you
			to enter private information need to ensure that the information is secure and cannot be accessed by any external parties. The user should 
			also be notified that their data is being collected [3] – this is normal done through the ‘cookies notification’ often seen on websites. 
			Another aspect that needs to be considered when a user’s private information is required, is ensuring that the user does not need to enter 
			unnecessary data for whatever they are trying to accomplish on that given platform. This may cause the user to feel that the platform cannot 
			be trusted and may also cause them to find a new platform that does a similar task without wasting their time by filling out masses of 
			information.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ensuring the user’s inclusivity and accessibility is achieved throughout the platform a user is interacting with, is good ethical UI/UX 
			practice. This will allow the vast range of users, despite any of their circumstances, to use and navigate around the platform without any 
			feelings of exclusion. This can be achieved by providing alternative text options, changes in colour appearance, different supporting
			keyboards, changing the language and adjusting to certain cultures. Of course, things like language barriers and cultural differences are not 
			always easy to adjust to and comes with the type of audience the platform is trying to reach. However, it is important to find some way of 
			adjusting platforms to include people who may have certain incapacities such as being colourblind, having dyslexia, having trouble reading 
			small fonts, etc. A good way to adjust digital platforms to be more inclusive, can be by having user input features as an aspect in the 
			platform’s design.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ethical persuasive design is another concept to think about with regard to UI/UX design. Certain techniques in UI/UX design can often 
			encourage users to buy certain products, share certain posts and adopt certain behaviours – this links back to the addictive behaviour. 
			It is important to ensure that these techniques used to persuade users provides accurate and honest information to inspire users to make
			mindful decisions. User confidentiality and influence is so vital in terms of UI/UX design and there are laws and regulations that are being 
			put into place that protect the user’s rights to transparency and privacy. With user discretion, the user’s consent should be explicit and 
			should not be persuaded to consent to any decisions regarding their interaction with any digital platforms [4].
		</p>
		<p>
			Taking all these aspects into account, NetFlorist’s website will be analysed to gage how ethical their UI/UX design and interaction is. 
			NetFlorist is South Africa’s leading flower delivery website, with branches in different parts of the world, that delivers a vast range of 
			flower arrangements and gifts [5]. Upon first encounter, it appears that NetFlorist adheres to numerous ethical UI/UX design, however there
			are many aspects of their interactive design that may be questionable.
		</p>
		<p>
			The allure to addictive design – NetFlorist’s website does not include any auto playing videos or push notifications, thus being sustainable 
			and efficient for customer use. Although, the website can be seen to have a case of ‘infinite scrolling’ if the user does not have an idea of 
			what they want to purchase or search for on the platform. Their extensively large range of gifts can be quite overwhelming and can 
			unconsciously lead users to infinitely scroll throughout the various options, admiring what is on offer, rather than buying or searching for 
			what they initially visited the website for. However, the site combats this by categorising every gift and arrangement to specific types and 
			occasions to help narrow down the user’s decision on what to purchase. The website also features a filter that can be used to help with making
			these decisions. The site also visibly displays their ‘x’ buttons so that users are not allured into visiting parts of the site they are not 
			interested in. However, these buttons could be made slightly more visible by changing their background colour so its even easier to identify.
		</p>
		<p>
			Keeping data private – The site adheres to all privacy matters in terms of UI/UX design. The cookies that help to encrypt data are embedded in
			the site, along with all information being secure. NetFlorist does a good job at ensuring their users are aware that they need to fill in 
			certain information, without having them fill out unnecessary data. The site takes it one step further by ensuring a login account is created,
			which is secured with a username and password. This is a promising way to reassure users that their banking details and other information is 
			kept private, and that the platform can be trusted. Overall, they abide by privacy laws and have a very appropriately secure site.
		</p>
		<p>
			Inclusivity and accessibility – NetFlorist’s audience is primarily the working class and does well at ensuring that that range of people’s 
			preferences, in terms of gifts and prices, are met. There are many filters on the site that allow users to alter price ranges that are more 
			suited to their budget, which is a good way of including people who cannot afford more expensive item. NetFlorist’s range of gifts is
			inclusive of all genders and holidays throughout the year, which makes their business operational and effective all year round. The site also
			has a user input in the form of ratings and reviews, which can help the company with bettering their products, however there is none of this 
			for the site itself, which could be beneficial for their site development and can better their UI/UX design. The site falls short by not
			having the option to change the language settings. South Africa has eleven official languages, but the site is only displayed through English.
			This can be seen as problematic and may turn away customers that do not speak English, which ultimately affects the potential for more profit.
			A lot of the text on the website is quite small and can be difficult to read. The site does not have the option to change the font size or 
			style and may lead to users having to zoom in and out, which can eventually lead to some difficulty navigating around the platform.
		</p>
		<p>
			Persuasive design – The site does not have persuasive design, every choice navigated around the platform, what to purchase, and what to browse
			is all based on the user. There is a page that pops up before finalising the purchase, that offers the user items that they can add onto 
			whatever it is that they are purchasing. This could be seen as persuasive design as the consumer could come across as asking the customer to
			spend more money and time on the website, however the are clear ways to exit this page and continue with payment. The platform intelligently
			avoids persuasive design by categorising each of their items so customers can easily select their gifts based on type and proceed to 
			purchasing. Persuasion is also combatted with how their home page is set up, as the options, which are the categories, on the navigation bar 
			also appear on the home page. It’s a simple ‘get in, get out’ website.
		</p>
		<p>
			General UI/UX and interaction – Overall, NetFlorist has achieved a fairly ethical UI/UX design and has adhered to user security by protecting
			the user’s private information that is required on the site. Although NetFlorist has done a decent job at attaining all the major aspects of 
			ethical UI/UX design, their site could use some improvements with regards to its general design and functionality. It was mentioned above that
			UI and UX goes beyond the aesthetic and functionality of an interface, however all these things work in conjunction with one another and how
			the user interacts with the platform is important [6]. The site feels a bit congested as there is a lot going on and a lot to look at on their
			home page. There is also an abundance of text that seems to be used to fill out negative space. This makes the website look very crowded and
			can be fixed by reducing the amount of additional information to read, outside the main focus of the site. To reduce the amount to look at,
			the site can spread out their information on the home page to make it more palatable for the user. The site could also place all this 
			information in an ‘About’ page, so users have the option of looking at it. Certain onclick links/words on the site aren’t easy to recognise 
			because the only change that occurs when hovering over these things is the cursor. An easy fix for this would be highlighting the 
			word/background of the word when hovering over it, as well as having small descriptions about where these links take the user. The navbar 
			takes up a lot of space on all the pages and makes it feel like the user has little viewing access to the rest of that page. This can be
			bettered by making the images smaller on the main pages or even in the navbar. The site has a chatbot which is a great feature for this kind
			of website because of the various categories to navigate around and the many questions users may have.
		</p>
		<p>
			Altogether NetFlorist has created an ethical UI/UX design for their website which keeps the user in mind and how certain aspects of their 
			site can affect them. The site’s navigation is linear and is also user friendly but could use a few minor adjustments to make it easier to 
			interact with and navigate around for the user. Despite these minor issues, the site was pleasant to analyse and did not cause any issues 
			upon use.
