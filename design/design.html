	<h1>The Design Process of the Mikisha-verse</h1>
	<p>
		Within the past 4 weeks, we've focused on trying to fill our websites with very basic content. We've tried to gather materials and plan out
		what our websites will look like. You will see my very first wireframe ideas in <a href="../blogs/week2.html"> week 2</a> of my blog posts (my
		apologies - it looked terrible), and how it's changed over the course of the past few weeks.
	</p>
	<p>
		I want my website to flow, be easy for the user to read and navigate around, and visually aesthetic. I've made these wireframes below to show
		you some idea about how I want the website pages to look on a desktop and on a phone.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h2> Website view on desktop screen size:</h2>
		<img src="../images/designs/desktopWireframe.png" width="693" height="350"
				 alt="A picture showing the wireframe for the Home page of this website on a desktop screen"
				 title="Desktop Home page wireframe view">
		<img src="../images/designs/blogPageWireframe.png" width="693" height="350"
				 alt="A picture showing the wireframe for the blog page of this website on a desktop screen"
				 title="Blog page wireframe - Desktop view">
		<img src="../images/designs/profileWireframe.png" width="693" height="350"
				 alt="A picture showing the wireframe for the profile page of this website on a desktop screen"
				 title=" Profile page wireframe - Desktop view">
	</p>
	<p>
		I've annotated the images in blue to show you what my plan of action is regarding how I want the website to look at a very basic level.
		So far, I have executed most of this wireframe to date (17/03/2024) and will adjust it more as the semester continues. I will also show you
		any new ideas that come to mind and if they influence any changes to the design of my website.

		<h2> Website view on phone screen size:</h2>

		<img src="../images/designs/phoneWireframe.png" width="600" height="600"
				 alt="A picture showing the wireframe for the Home page of this website on a phone screen"
				 title="Home page wireframe - Phone view">

		<img src="../images/designs/phoneBlogPage.png" width="400" height="600"
				 alt="A picture showing the wireframe for the blog page of this website on a phone screen"
				 title="Blog page wireframe - Phone view">

		<img src="../images/designs/phoneProfile.png" width="400" height="600"
				 alt="A picture showing the wireframe for the profile page of this website on a phone screen"
				 title=" Profile page wireframe - Phone view">
	</p>
	<p>
		Just like the desktop view of the website, the phone view will be similar but just scaled down to size with everything in proportion. The
		phone view will also allow the users to scroll up or down to access information that would usually be spread over one desktop screen.
	</p>

		<h2> Brainstorming Styles:</h2>

		<img src="../images/designs/Style.png" width="1200" height="600"
				 alt="A picture showing style idea for the website colours, fonts and potential logo"
				 title="First style ideas">
	</p>
	<p>
		I was looking at colours I would like to incorporate into my website and, through the annotaions, you can see that I would like the background
		colour of the website to be black and have accent colours themed to each page and their content. I've included color swatches that I think would
		look nice against a black background, and a sample design of what I want as background design. The background design will most likey be used
		throughout the website and be a "general theme" for the whole portfolio website. In the corner, I have a possible logo idea that I want to include
		in my URL and throughout the web pages. In terms of fonts, I looked at a range of fonts that I thought would be suitable for general text
		throughout my website or possibly be used as headings. If anything changes and there are more updates on the website, I will be sure to show them
		here.
