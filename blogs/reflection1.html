				The past few weeks have been such a great experience because of all that I’ve learnt through building this website. I’ve tried my hardest to
				have the correct semantic mark up throughout my code and I think I’ve done a pretty decent job. Creating content, such as the design, blog 
				and home pages has been fairly fun and so far, everything looks quite net and structured, although I really can’t wait to incorporate css 
				code and javascript into the website to make it look a thousand times better.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think I struggled quite a bit initially with github and trying to see every minor change I made to the website after pushing the changes 
				and waiting for the website to update through git. It was so tedious and long until I realised you could just open the website from your 
				file and see any changes you’ve made there, before uploading it to github. Gosh, putting that down in writing and hearing me say it out 
				aloud, really makes me sound like a rookie at all of this. I most definitely was, and I think the past few weeks has also just given me more
				practice on how to do things more efficiently. I guess practice does make perfect (of course “perfect” here, means being more efficient).
			</p>
			<p>
				The website is not fully fleshed out and hasn’t reach anything close to its potential as yet, so changes are bound to happen over the next 
				few days/weeks. I definitely want to add more to the website and fill it with more content, which will add to the aesthetic I am going for 
				or trying to go for at this point. I would also like to start looking into incorporating css code into my website so I can start including 
				more structure and more flow into the navigation and aesthetic of my website. I also want to do more research into fonts and how they impact
				the user, so I know which fonts to use moving forward, to accommodate as many users as possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				The things I’ve become proud of throughout these 4 weeks has got be the progress I made through coding and the development of the website so
				far. Yes – it’s not as pretty as it could be yet, but I will eventually get to that stage and be just as proud then. I’ve actually thoroughly
				enjoyed this entire journey so far because the approach to building this website has been a combination of using a technical and creative 
				side. This is something that really piques my interest and actually has me contemplating what I would like to specialise in my final year of
				university.
