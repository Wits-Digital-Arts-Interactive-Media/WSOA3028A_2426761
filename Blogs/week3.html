		<h1> Interaction Design for the web</h1>
		<h3> Week 3 (26/02 - 01/03)</h3>
	</center>

	<p>
		<h4>Interaction Design - Lecture:</h4>
		This week''s lecture built onto what we learnt last week about interaction. 'Interaction'' is still pretty much similar to what we learnt 
		last week. We learnt that something is interactive if it is responsive and doesn't respond in a completely random manner - yes, the opposite
		of what we learnt 'interaction' to be. We also learnt about how interaction between a user and a system is done through interface. Interface 
		is the symbolic meeting place between an active body and that which it can affect [1]. In simple words, this means that interface is the space
		or environment which allows you the opportunity to interact with certain things. Interface is also described as designing a way to represent and
		control interactions that take place within a system [2]. This falls back onto how we would like our websites to look and how we would want them 
		to be navigated around. This would mean that our website is sort of the interface that allows the users to interact with your content. It also
		reflects on how we would like the system to work for users and how the user can interact with it.

		<h4>Semantic Markup:</h4>
		This week we learnt about semantic markup in html. Seems like it's a very practical and structured way to make it easier to read and understand 
		code for others looking at it, as well as being beneficial for your own understanding. It's definitely made it easier to code this website 
		because I had a lot of unnecessary code, I didn't even understand that was incorporated into it. Building on the website, I've found it quite
		cool to place images and links into the code, as well as making use of hypertext throughout each of my pages. Its also pretty cool adding in
		these blog posts. Some of the characters I've been using in Microsoft Word when I type out my blogs, aren't recognised in html code. So, there's
		a lot of sifting I have to do after I've copied and pasted my blog text into visual studio. In a weird way, its so cool to see the page take 
		shape once I've done all the editing. It makes me feel very professional and seem like I know what I'm doing with regards to building this 
		website and filling it with content.
	</p>

	<h4>Goal Alignment:</h4>

	<ul>
		
		<li>
			After doing some more planning and working on my website in visual studio, I would like the main goal to be that the navigation in and
			around my website and its web pages to be easy. I plan on accomplishing this by making use of simple code and doing what I understand in
			regard to that. I would also like to have as much in my website as possible so that when it comes to using css code and javascript, I will
			have more time to familiarise myself with those languages and use them effectively to execute what I am trying to achieve with my website.
		</li>

		<li>
			I would like for the user to have an easy and enjoyable experience with my website. I want them to find it easy to engage with and navigate
			around my website, as well as having some fun while they explore each web page. I want to make sure my website is aesthetically pleasing to users.
			I essentially want to woo any user that comes across my website, in a creative and logical way.
		</li>

		<li>
			In regard to the content shown on my website, I would like for it to impress users and show them a real side to the website's creator (me of
			course). Yes, there will be an overall theme, but I want each webpage to appear as of the user is entering a different realm but of the same
			universe.
		</li>
	</ul>
	 
	<p> <h4>My site's content and experience:</h4>
		I would like my site to capture as much of my essence as possible. Reflecting on last week's 'file idea' for my website, I have realised that 
	  that idea isn't really me and doesn't have any relevance to the person I am. Since this is a portfolio website, I would like my audience to feel 
	  like they have truly learnt about me and almost know me to a personal level. Of course, I wouldn't want to overwhelm them with unnecessary 
	  information and over crowd this website with too many words, but I do want it to be a pretty enjoyable and fun experience exploring my website. 
	  I would also like my website to be pretty easy to navigate around and I want to make sure the UI and UX is at a good standard.
	</p>

	<p>
	  In terms of content, I would like my website to include a side of me I don't express enough, which is my artsy side. I'd like to have a page 
	  that is dedicated to all my older and newer art pieces. I've even been trying to create more art in recent to have more content for that page. 
	  I was thinking about having sections within this page to navigate between the different mediums of art. I haven't really figured out what else 
	  to add to the website other than my art, but I'll be brainstorming as I develop the page more. I would also love for my website to have some 
	  artistic flair and I will be more than excited to implement these ideas into my website.
	</P>

	<p>
		<h4>Structure and URL scheme:</h4>
	  I haven't really thought too much about the URL scheme, but I realised that based on how semantic markup is used, the URL can change and make 
	  it rather lengthy (I think - don't hang this over my head if I'm wrong). I definitely need to go into more research regarding semantic markup and 
	  how it affects URLs, to ensure my URL looks precise throughout the use of my website and that it is easy to remember.
	</P>

	<p> <h4>Website Progress:</h4>
		Okay, I'm going to be real with you here. I haven't done much besides adding my blogs and editing them in the code where it is necessary...
	  so progress has been slow, however I am definitely getting somewhere and I am adding stuff onto the website each week, so it doesn't pile up 
	  when it comes to the assignment. I'm actually glad that despite this busy period I am still managing with work and getting things done. I really 
	  don't want to be hating myself in a few weeks if all of this piles up :(
	</p> 

	<p>

		We went into further depth regarding semantic markup, so I would like to start putting those tools and my new understanding to practice in my 
		code and hopefully do a good job as I progress.
