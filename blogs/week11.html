				<h4> <b>The incorporation of javascript into my website and how it affects my interaction design:</b></h4>
				Unfortunately, I didn’t get around to adding as much javascript as I wanted to, so there’s not a lot of interaction with the website as yet.
				I incorporated some javascript that allows an image to rotate or spin in its place and also allows interaction with the user where the
				rotating image can be hovered over, and it enlarges. It also makes text appear as a link that takes the user to a different page on the
				website when clicked. In class we also used javascript to create a navbar that showed the user which pages they were on. This is something
				I wanted to implement across other pages on the website that uses navigation. Because this wasn’t executed well before the assignment 2 due
				date, it will be done throughput the next few weeks to ensure that there is better use of javascript across the whole website. I want to
				work on more animations having to do with the images and icons on my website and how they interact with the user and their navigation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Throughout actually implementing javascript for assignment 2 of this website, I came across many ideas I thought about that I want to
				execute throughout my website much too late and will start to incorporate them into the code to ensure I reach the level of interactivity
				I want to achieve.

				<h4>Analysis of the readings:</h4>
				‘The road to Technocolonialism’ talks about the geopolitical implications of artificial intelligence development.
				The article says that the main countries that dominate the artificial intelligence growth is America and China. Their changes and
				development in artificial intelligence has a major influence and impact on the world. The talk about techno-colonialism comes from the
				idea that the powers of AI can extend their political and economical powers over the world. There is a fear that AI can be exchanged for
				political influence and access to information. This is terrifying because the AI tool will be used for malicious means rather than the
				development and benefit of the world. This development could lead to the control and dominance over certain countries, particularly third
				world countries, which will result in a technological colonialism.
			</p>
			<p>
				The article gives some examples of how technocolonialism is already in play, as China and America increase their influence onto certain
				African countries through economic dependence, data collection, control of digital ecosystems and much more. This shows that there can be
				extensive progress in technocolonialism as African countries become more dependent on China and America for AI technology. What’s stopping
				them from doing this across other continents too? Having countries depend on China and America for technology and AI tools, gives China and
				America the upper hand on power and places them in a huge position of control. I know I said this above, but I want you to understand the
				extent of how problematic this is. The colonialism with regards to technology in a technological world will cause major divide and a
				difference in accessibility across all countries with and without access to technology and the internet. It’s crazy to think that we’ve
				(mostly) escaped colonialism but there are ways in which it finds its way back… and through technology and access to information?? I can’t
				imagine why the world we live in is full of people who always want the upper hand and cannot help the next person. Ensuring that people are
				treated equally with regard to access to information and access to technology, should not have to raise concerns about who controls those
				things and who benefits most from it. Helping people with technology and information in this technological age should be second nature.
