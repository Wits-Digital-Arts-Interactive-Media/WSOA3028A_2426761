      <h2>Internet, Society and Design Justice</h2>
      <h3>Week 8 (08/04 - 12/04)</h3>
    <section>
			<p>
				Having a look at the topic of ‘internet, society and design justice’ after writing an essay on ethical UI and UX design, I noticed that a 
        lot of these things link together. With regard to how ethical UI and UX design affects users and is more effective by including as many
        users as possible, internet, society and design justice plays a huge role in ensuring that the inclusion of all users is met. A nice term 
        for it is ‘digital equality’ which is the dissection of political, social, cultural, economic dimensions in society today, and ultimately 
        striving to ensure that we do not widen inequalities through digital technologies [1]. This is such an incredible stance in the age of 
        technology as it has become a part of everyday life and function. Although the internet can be a scary place, allowing as many people as 
        possible to have access to the internet and technologies can do wonders in many different ways too.
			</p>

				This may be a weird perspective to this type of thing, but I think digital inclusion is such a great thing and can help people, cultures, 
        religions and societies in various ways, however, I think that people who are exposed to the internet should have the option of when to use 
        it. I guess that’s the point of this whole blog really. To talk about people having access to the internet and doing what they can with that
        access. Only half of the world’s population has access to internet [2] and even though that is a lot of people, more people should have the 
        access to information to better their lives and whatever else they choose fit. Digital inclusion of people who may have disabilities and
        ensuring their needs are met with digital design is something I fully stand behind. It is so important for everyone to feel welcome and
        accommodated for, especially in the world of technology. I truly believe that the more people, of various types, have access to the internet
        and information the better.

				One of the readings done this week goes into detail about ‘design justice’. It talks about how design justice is an approach to design that
        is led by communities that aims to explicitly challenge structural inequalities [3]. This means they are actively targeting inequality 
        throughout design in order to get a fully inclusive design system in place. This not only targets major problems with design but tries 
        mending the minor issues within design inequality too. The focus is to connect design to larger struggles for collective liberation and 
        ecological survival [3], and to ensure that there are no means of discrimination against any groups of people across the internet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, I think its vital to be inclusive of as many groups of people as possible to ensure a cohesive and more comprehendible society. 
        Discrimination against any person or groups of people is not acceptable and this should apply to the general use of the internet and access
        to information. I strongly agree and believe that everyone in the world should have access to internet and use it to their discretion, 
        without bias or discrimination against anyone to whom they may interact with.
