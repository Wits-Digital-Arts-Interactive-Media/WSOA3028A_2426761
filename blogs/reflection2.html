				Throughout learning javascript, I found it pretty interesting, confusing and fun. My brain couldn’t wrap around the idea of having working
				html in conjunction to javascript. I watched some of the lecture videos and they did somewhat help, but doing the java file example with 
				Hani, where we created a navigation bar on our index page really helped.
			</p>
			<p>
				I really want my website to be as interactive as possible and allow the user to feel like they have the freedom to play around with as much
				as possible on my website. I didn’t manage to get a lot of animations done for the website, however I managed to create a working java 
				function that rotates an image in place, enlarges an image when the cursor hovers over it and make links appear onhover as well. This 
				taught me how similar javascript is to c# which made the understanding of it a lot easier.
				Due to this miracle extension, I was able to execute more javascript and I managed to also create buttons for my blog posts that navigate 
				between each post. I was so confused on how to show my blog posts on one single page because I had written them on different pages. With 
				the use of iframes I was able to do this, and it ended up turning out exactly how I wanted it to. There’s still so much to do because of 
				how things are set up and I am hard coding css in correspondence with the java in order to get my animations working the way I want to and
				just getting a visualisation on my set up in preparation for css. I’ve used divs for the animations and code relating to the javascript 
				in order to help with some of these visualisations. It’s been very effective and helpful in shaping my ideas and betting what I’ve created 
				so far, and what I am going to create in the near future.
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, with javascript, I am quite happy with some of the stuff I have implemented but I still have so much more I want to do and play 
				around with.

			</p>
			<p>
				The blog wireframes in my design section doesn’t correspond to what I’ve done with my blog page and its javascript functions because I
				think that what I managed to do in this extension with the blog page is much more effective and easier to navigate around for the user. 
				I also just prefer how it looks and how simple it is to work around. I will add more to it and ensure it captures the ‘vibe’ I want it to
				give off, but for now it’s exactly how I want it.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am also looking forward to implementing css into my website as this will shape my ideas better and help me execute what I am visualising
				in my head.
