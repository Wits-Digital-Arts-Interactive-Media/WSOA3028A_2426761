				<h4> Values of Play: Design Tradeoffs in Society-Oriented Game Design.</h4>				
				This extract discusses what is referred to as the “RAPUNSEL project”, which is a game environment that teaches middle-school girls 
				how to programme. This project came about because of the concern that the interest in maths, science and computing has declined among 
				younger females. The game creates a dancing environment, in which the girls have to programme characters to create dance sequences using 
				JavaScript. The reading talks about how the game doubles as a way to teach the girls social skills, creative and novel engagement with
				technology. I think this is phenomenal and is such a good way to integrate teaching and learning through games. This approach to teach the
				girls how to code is so good because it’ll be an easier way for them to learn, rather than just seeing code and having to create things
				without any goals. This game addresses the issue of gender imbalances in the STEM environment and will help to improve these problems for 
				the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				The extract also talks about battling with integrating values into the design process and how they managed to come up with an idea on how
				to do this and what challenges they would be faced with. Here are some of the significant value’s dimensions: The game is aimed to
				challenge gender biases and empower young girls in technology, which makes it a politically charged game. The creators also got input 
				and involvement from teachers, parents, and industry reps, to help integrate feedback with varying political, social and ethical views. 
				Character representation was also considered as games can often raise questions about gender, race stereotypes, social rewards, and 
				interaction style.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Methodologies for integrating these values: they are working on designing systems that embody shared values, which is presented
				through the technology design. They encourage practitioners to engage in reflective conversations about the design problems between 
				beliefs and actions. They look into playtesting and iterative reflection from the users and ask for feedback based on user preference 
				and cultural values.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is so important for companies creating games that have a diverse audience to take all of these things into account because of how 
				many users it may affect. Gaming is one of the easiest ways to learn, so if there are issues in the design of the game that teaches 
				people incorrect values, those aspects of the game must be addressed and dealt with in order to create a safer learning environment. 
				This idea of the RAPUNSEL project is such a great concept and will really add value to the technological and digital world. As a girly 
				in STEM, who was also not really exposed to much technology and coding at a young age, I genuinely feel like this will work wonders for 
				girls around the world and give them another option to consider for careers they might want to pursue.
			</p>

				<h4>A Game Design Methodology to incorporate Social Activist Themes</h4>				
				This article is sort of similar to the one above, in that their focus is on game design for women and the exploration of educational
				and activist game approaches. They discuss the importance of games and their cultural significance, which can reinforce values and 
				beliefs, whether intentional or not. There is an important point they make about how games can embody both positive and negative themes.
				They use “The Sims” as an example of consumerism and “Grand Theft Auto” for stereotypes. The point they are making is that game designers
				need to intentionally embed values and ethical thinking into their design to ensure users are socially conscious. The RAPUNSEL project
				(as discussed above) is mentioned to be a good example of a game that has a goal to teach under privileged girls how to programme, and 
				simultaneously promote values of gender equity. The mention of the RAPUNSEL project is to draw from their practices and goals to design
				games that influence industry practices and create more communal and inclusive games.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think what this extract is trying to achieve is so meaningful and important because future generations will definitely be more inclined
				to learning through games and it is extremely vital to ensure that what people are learning from games besides understanding and gaining
				knowledge is to attain good morals and views about life, as well as equipping them with important skill sets that will aid them for their
				futures.

				<h4>Css experience:</h4>
				So far, the css experience has been good… to be fair I don’t really have a frame of reference, but I think it’s going well. I’ve managed
				to use css to update the look of the index page of my website. As I explore the various things css can do, I realised that I have veered 
				off of what my ‘final’ wireframes are. I seem to be gravitating back to this idea of a ‘universe’ theme and navigating through that 
				universe. I also realised that I want to incorporate a lot more javascript because I want to include a few more animations that I think
				will give off the exact vibe I want my website to exude. I am really enjoying this part of coding the website because it’s been 
				materialising my ideas and I love seeing what’s going on in my head become real.
			</p>
			<p>
				I want to make sure that I am able to apply similar style sheets to every html file in my website. I also want to see how else I can make
				this website more exciting and easier to read for as many users as possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4>Other thoughts:</h4>
				I am trying to keep the topic of the next essay in mind and ensure that I can discuss the idea of digital colonialism to the appropriate 
				extent, covering as many bases as possible. I just want to jot down my ideas of topics I’d like to discuss.
				<ul>-	Gender-pay gap in digital companies. </ul>
				<ul>-	How technology and the internet are being used to create divide between countries and making certain countries assume positions of 
					power in regard to access to information and digital tools.</ul>
				<ul>-	Problems that digital colonialism causes and how it affects the economy, growth and development.</ul>
				<ul>-	How these things can affect people living in third world countries and the impact its had on South Africa.</ul>
				<ul>-	I need to do some more in-depth research on this topic.</ul>
