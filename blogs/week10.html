				Reading: ‘Making a feminist internet in Africa: Why the internet needs African feminists and feminism’
			</p>
			<p>
				For this week’s blog post we were asked to look closely into one of the listed readings. I just had to do this one because as a woman in
				STEM, who also lives in Africa, I thought it was fit.
			</p>
			<p>
				To give some slight insight on feminism as a whole, because I know a lot of it is misunderstood and processed incorrectly. Feminism isn’t 
				the act of only fighting for woman’s right but is a fight for equality across all genders.
			</p>
			<p>
				The reading was written in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The article goes into detail about how information and misinformation about
				how the coronavirus is contracted, how it spreads, and what precautions to take to prevent contraction, made its way to the internet. How 
				the coronavirus led to people meeting online, instead of in person, is presented as an issue in the reading as it mentions that the internet
				was presented as a solution to social problems which created a false sense of equality of access, use and representation of the internet [1].
				The reading goes into further detail explaining that meeting online affects the gathering of activists in Africa to ‘make’ a feminist 
				internet. “We need even more African feminists and feminisms on, in, around the internet” – one of the quotes from the article suggesting 
				that there should be more feminists interacting with the internet, however, there needs to be more ‘African’ feminists, and this is why…
			</p>
			<p>
				…the article discusses how a meeting held about working on technology and its effects in shaping the realities of women, LGBTQIA people, 
				people with disabilities and people who exist on the margins of normative societies have explores what a feminist internet can look like [1].
				From the meeting the first draft of the Feminist Principles of the Internet (FPIs) was formed. Due to these meetings a lot has changed in 
				technology and the internet all over the world. As a result, many communities and societies were able to gain visibility and there was
				progression in reporting incidences like gender-based violence. Their point is that all the changes in technology significantly affects how 
				our society evolves and functions [1]. Linking all of this to Africa (because I know you probably thought I went off on a tangent there).
				The article talks about how the historical differences in access to internet globally represents inequality, oppression and suppression. 
				Africa being one of the many continents that have been disadvantaged by all these aspects, needs to be put out there in order to shift these
				issues.
			</p>
			<p>
				Africa is discussed to feel like it is the ‘world’s laboratory’ and how it’s been treated as such. The article talks about Western 
				pharmaceutical companies test drugs illegally in Africa and gives an example of when Pfizer illegally tested an anti-meningitis drug on 
				children in Nigeria, which resulted in disabilities and death. The article goes into detail talking about how the continent is often made 
				to seem like a beneficiary of technology, rather than an innovator of it. Africa innovates based on the existing problems within the 
				continent and does not innovate for fun, technology in Africa is something used in order to change lives for the better (this is a 
				generalisation). It’s unfortunate that Africa hasn’t always been the creators of their narratives, but now it is important to do so,
				especially in the technological space. Doing this won’t just benefit people in Africa but will create a network to and from Africa in which
				to help people globally. Africa can and has made serious headway with being included on the internet and in certain technologies, which will
				make all the more difference in the grand scheme of things. It will also help societies and communities that have suffered with the 
				exclusion of the internet and give them more opportunities to be heard and become innovators too.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having a feminist internet will also shy away unnecessary issues of misogyny, discrimination and bias that the internet still faces today. 
				It will allow for more equality across all groups of people and will help to ensure needs are met globally regarding the internet.
