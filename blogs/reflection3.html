		<h2>Mini Reflection 3</h2>
		<h3>Exam week (19/06 - 24/06)</h3>
		<section>
			<p>
				This is my last reflection for the semester, and I wanted to show my appreciation towards everyone who helped me learn and grow in this 
				subject and have aided in getting me this far with my website. I am truly grateful and exceptionally happy to have worked and collaborated
				with everyone, I deeply thank you.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am so happy with how the mikisha-verse turned out, and the many animations, responsive designs and styles I was able to incorporate into
				my website. Although I did not manage to execute everything I wanted, the website works a lot better since assignment 3 and has some cool 
				new added features and functionalities. I added a burger menu to accommodate for smaller screen sizes, I made the navbar remain in place 
				after scrolling, I added a little animation to my profile page (it’s not exactly what I wanted to do, but because of time I had to make do 
				with what I could manage), I added more to my portfolio page and I scaled all images to make sure they include responsive design.
			</p>
			<p>
				I wanted to try and incorporate a stary background to give off a space/universe theme, but I did not get around to this, nor did I have a 
				chance to try and add in an animation on the index page that plays when the screen loads. However, despite not executing these plans, the 
				website turned out to be interactive, responsive and a refelction of me, which is what I was aiming to achieve. Had I started earlier with 
				assignment 4, I surely would have produced more work that would have been even more interactive and furthermore responsive. All in all, I 
				am happy and will definitely be using this project as a means to practice more web development and ensure I sharpen my skills. Thank you 
				for the fun journey.
