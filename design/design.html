				Within the past 4 weeks, we've focused on trying to fill our websites with very basic content. We've tried to gather materials and plan out
				what our websites will look like. You will see my very first wireframe ideas in <a href="../blogs/week2.html"> week 2</a> of my blog posts (my
				apologies - it looked terrible), and how it's changed over the course of the past few weeks. You will also find the <b>user flow</b> and
				<b>information structure</b> of this website in my <a href="../blogs/week4.html"> week 4</a> blog post.
			</p>
			<p>
				I want my website to flow, be easy for the user to read and navigate around, and visually aesthetic. I've made these wireframes below to show
				you some idea about how I want the website pages to look on a desktop and on a phone.
			</p>

			<p>
				I've annotated the images in blue to show you what my plan of action is regarding how I want the website to look at a very basic level.
				So far, I have executed most of this wireframe to date (17/03/2024) and will adjust it more as the semester continues. I will also show you
				any new ideas that come to mind and if they influence any changes to the design of my website.

				Just like the desktop view of the website, the phone view will be similar but just scaled down to size with everything in proportion. The
				phone view will also allow the users to scroll up or down to access information that would usually be spread over one desktop screen.

				I was looking at colours I would like to incorporate into my website and, through the annotaions, you can see that I would like the background
				colour of the website to be black and have accent colours themed to each page and their content. I've included color swatches that I think would
				look nice against a black background, and a sample design of what I want as background design. The background design will most likey be used
				throughout the website and be a "general theme" for the whole portfolio website. In the corner, I have a possible logo idea that I want to include
				in my URL and throughout the web pages. In terms of fonts, I looked at a range of fonts that I thought would be suitable for general text
				throughout my website or possibly be used as headings. If anything changes and there are more updates on the website, I will be sure to show them
				here.

				So… you’ve noticed that my website is called the ‘Mikisha-verse’, right?
				One thing to know about me is that my creative outlook on things kind of runs free, and most of it generates in my head until I have to do very
				specific things, and thus go searching for references and inspiration. For instance, taking the name of my website into consideration, I thought
				it would be perfect to have a universe theme to my website where each main page would be represented by a galaxy and when you enter each page,
				each section within it would be represented by a planet or portals. My ideas were to use something similar to the images below for the universe theme.
				Being a someone who pays A LOT of attenion to detail, while coding in	javascript I realised how much time it would take to execute because I want to
				use my own images and animations. Of course, I haven’t learnt how	to animate anything yet.. so I scrapped my idea and went for a more simple
				approach that is more aligned to my first few ideas on styling above.

				In terms of my visual aesthetic, I really want my website to flow and be interactive. I want the user to be wowed by the UX and UI in my website.
				I had a look at this portfolio websites below, by Justine Soulie and I was immediately blown away. I love how the cursor interacts with the images on
				the main page and how it makes the user feel, this is something I want to do on my website and incite a similar feeling for the user. It sort of fast
				tracked my ideas on how to make this website feel more like me, while capturing my artistic flair. - this will be shown in the style guide below.

				Simply put; I want my website to be simple but stunning, interactive but peaceful, and a true reflection of me and my personality.

				These are a few of my designs for the final website, which is based around the ideas mentioned in brainstorming styles above and you’ll
				see that I am already using	them on the website. I will have them in a range of colours and have them placed appropriately to each page
				with their designated themes, fonts and colours. I know there's not a lot here, but I am working on finalising more designs. Overall,
				I want users to be as amazed with the general look and feel of the website,	as they are with the content.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second iteration of wireframes and their annotations for the final design are below. I want my site to look something like this with
				a lot of animations and events done through javascript – this is what will make the website interactive and achieve the type of user
				experience I want my audience to have.

				As you can see, from my very first wireframes a lot has changed. I kept quite a few of my initial ideas but bettered them to suit a
				certain style and theme. I would like my website to look a lot like these wireframes, or at least a version of them. So far, its going
				okay and I am able to execute some of these aspects.
			</p>
			<p>
				The view of the website on an iPad screen will be just like the view on a desktop or pc screen, but scaled to fit the dimensions of the
				iPad's screen.'
			</p>
			<p>
				With regard to fonts, I have decided to use the fonts in the headings of these wirframes for the headings throughout the website. However,
				I will look into a more dyslexia-friendly font that is more suitable to include more readers, but also displays the type of 'vibe' I am
				going for. In terms of the general text for articles, sentences and paragraphs throughout the website, I will eitheruse the fonts 'Arial'
				or 'Gadugi' so that all the content is readable for as many users as possible.

				These are the phone sized screen views of the website. The screens will (hopefully) adjust according to the relative screen size and have
				all animations working in accordance too.
			</p>
			<p>
				During one of our tut sessions, the importance of a footer was explained to me. I want to make sure that my website has a footer for
				each page	and for each screen size to ensure that my users know when they've reached the end of the page they are on.
