      <h4>Information Structure:</h4>

  </p>

  <p>
    The information structure will be simple, as seen in the image above. My website will most likely be ordered in this way, based on what I think
    takes priority in regard to what the user would like to see. This isn’t set in stone and will likely change with time because of my
    indecisiveness and desire to make everything aesthetically pleasing.

      <h4>User Flow:</h4>

    </center>
  </p>

  <p>
    I guess this is just a basic way of showing you that I would like the user flow to be very easy. I want the user to be able to access any page
    from wherever they are on the website. I want the user to also have access to the different pages and different content in an appropriate way
    so that there is proper navigation throughout the website. I want the include an arrow that allows the user to go back to which ever item they
    were previously on, however I don’t want arrow button to be the only option for navigation between pages.

    <h4>Noting my thoughts:</h4>
    I guess this section falls under the design part of this blog post… but anyway.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Target audience:</b> I would like my content to appeal to game design companies looking to hire and people who are interested in
      pursuing game design and people who like art and can appreciate the artistic process of composing, along with people who understand
      the process of coding and how it’s being used throughout every form of media presented through my website.
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Content:</b> As previously mentioned, I would like my content to have an artistic and creative flair to it, that is presented throughout the
      website and its corresponding pages. I would like my content to express a sort of vulnerable side to me, by displaying my art pieces, the
      projects I’ve worked on, the games I’ve helped create and created on my own, as well as showing the process of designing this website and the
      many iterations it’s been through.
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>User experience:</b> In addition to what I mentioned last week regarding user experience, I want to ensure the UI and UX is well used to
      benefit the user. This week we spoke about the importance of the three-clicks. It basically implies that the user shouldn’t have to use more
      than three clicks to get to where they want to, anywhere in your website. I want to ensure that this is incorporated into my website soon, to
      ensure that the UX and UI I am trying to achieve is easily met.
    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>
    Week 4 was mainly a focus on the design aspect of the website and integrating my thoughts into what I want certain aspects of the website to
    look like. However, upon building the website, a lot changes as I went along. My information structure was ordered based on what the assignment
    asked, rather than sticking to the idea I mapped out. I will go along with what I currently have and see about adapting it to better suit the
    content and the user.
